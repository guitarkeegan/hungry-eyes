Our group developed a food searching application that uses pictures as the deciding factor for findig a place to eat near the user's location. The application required two APIs: Yelp and Foodish. When the user opens the app they are asked for permission to use their location, if the user does not grant permission then a modal will appear later asking for their zip code or city name. Foodish generates random pictures of food. When the user clicks on a picture, Yelp searches for restuarants near the user's location and provides a list. The user selects a restuarant from the list and is provided with more information and links to Google Maps and Yelp. The user is also able to view their search food history which is saved to the local storage.
