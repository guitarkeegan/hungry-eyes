  ## Description
 
  A front end project, built with jQuery, Foodish API, and Yelp API. Users click a randomly generated picture of a food item, then they are show all of the resturants nearby that carry that food item.

  ## Installation

  To run locally, clone the project, then open up the index.html file in a browser of your choice. If you get a 404 error about a bad request, try checking the console if you have developer tools installed, and click on the suggestion about Heroku. This should fix the error, which is related to the site being hosted on Github pages.
